Hi! I'm Sarrwin Ramachandaran, a student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course.
As a Software Engineering student, I'm really excited to take WIF3005 because I know how important it is to keep software running smoothly and adapt it over time. I'm hoping to gain practical skills that will be useful in my future projects and career as a software engineer!
- **Fun fact**: I love watching movies during my free time.
- **Course expectations**: I expect this course can help me to gain and develop knowledge and skills in maintaining and evolving software, which will be valuable in handling real-world software projects. I also hope to learn effective techniques for software maintenance, understanding how to manage technical debt, perform refactoring, and ensure software scalability and reliability. These skills will assist me in future professional roles, particularly in sustaining long-term software projects, adapting to changing requirements, and contributing to the continuous improvement of systems.  .
